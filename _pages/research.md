### Under review

- *Can I Stay or Should I Go? Mandatory Retirement and Labor Force Participation of Older Workers*,  
[Revise and resubmit at the Journal of Public Economics]

    -  **Abstract**  
    _Retirement is commonly described as a pure labor-supply decision, despite the potential 
    importance of the demand side. This partly reflects that the two dimensions are often difficult 
    to disentangle. I here manage to overcome this difficulty by using  a unique natural experiment, 
    the progressive ban on mandatory retirement in France in the 2000s.  
    Drawing on an extensive administrative dataset, I use reform-induced  inter-industry variations in 
    mandatory-retirement legislation, thereby  separating this factor from other retirement determinants, 
    such as financial incentives.  I find that the demand-side determinants through mandatory retirement 
    do affect retirement patterns: the exit rates from employment are estimated to be 10% higher when mandatory 
    retirement is possible. This effect is mostly driven by individuals with high earnings, steep wage profiles 
    and good health. Second, as the mandatory-retirement age coincides with the full-rate age, I reveal a 
    previously unexamined determinant of the bunching in retirement distribution at this age. 
    Mandatory retirement is estimated to explain 12% of the observed spike at the full rate_

### Working papers

- *Unemployment*,  
with Tilbe Atav and Egbert Jongen

    - **Abstract**  
    This paper estimates the impact of financial incentives on retirement decision in France 
    for cohorts of men retiring between 1994 to 2012. During these two decades, a number of reforms 
    of the pension system took place, all aiming to achieve financial balance in a context of 
    increasing life expectancy. These reforms strengthened incentives to retire later, either 
    by offering more actuarially fair increase in pension for later retirement or by increasing 
    early and normal retirement ages. This paper aims to assess how much these financial incentives 
    and age references did contribute to the recent increase in employment rates of older workers.
